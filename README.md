# Blender-NonlinearChaosDynamics
This repository contains the files needed to conduct simulation of nonlinear and chaotic dynamics in Blender. This work was the final year project by Aidan Lee for the Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering in University College Dublin.



The .blend files are Blender files containing the simulated systems.

The Matlab .m files were used to conduct analysis of these systems.

OGBscript.py is a script that is run in the Blender text editor to generate and simulate the Oscillating Galton Board.



Videos of the dynamic systems can be found in this YouTube playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcPvAkNpP8kZxgqjEWTZy50DW96YnCApb.
