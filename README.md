# Blender-NonlinearChaosDynamics
This repository contains the files needed to conduct simulation of nonlinear and chaotic dynamics in Blender. This work was the final year project by Aidan Lee for the Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering in University College Dublin.

Videos of the dynamic systems can be found in this YouTube playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcPvAkNpP8kZxgqjEWTZy50DW96YnCApb.
